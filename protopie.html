          From 2017, I've been leading the design of ProtoPie Cloud, a Saas for
          designers to share prototypes and collaborate. Expand prototyping
          experience from individual to team or group.

      <h2>What is ProtoPie?</h2>
      <p>
          ProtoPie is the most intuitive tool to turn ideas into highly interactive prototypes for mobile, desktop, web, all the way to IoT. The software supports individuals and teams to ideate, iterate, and innovates tomorrow‚Äôs best digital products.

        <h4>üìà Business Needs</h4>
        <p>
          The most important reason. we saw the opportunity to grow the business
          from an increasing number of corporate and team users.

      <div class="half">
        <h4>üò£User Needs</h4>
        <p>
          Along with the development of ProtoPie Studio, ProtoPie users
          requested more advanced collaboration features related to the sharing
          and management of prototypes.

    <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Not enough design resources to support exploratory research and fast
        design iterations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Too many stakeholders including development, strategy, marketing in the
        process of synthesizing an MVP model
      </li>
      <li>
        Expand ProtoPie user experience from prototyping to collaboration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Define subscription system and find a way to introduce it in a seamless
        way
      </li>

      - Not enough design resources for exploratory research and fast iterations
      <br />
      - Too many stakeholders including development, business, marketing. <br />
      - Expand the context and flow of the product from prototyping to
      collaboration. <br />
      - Subscription Lifecycle and its impact on ProtoPie Studio

      <h2>Design System 1.0</h2>
      <p>
        With the help of a brand designer and other product designers, I built
        the design system of ProtoPie Cloud. with the help fo Figma + Storybook
        <br /><br />
        üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨¬†Product Designer¬†could deliver UI design in fast iterations.
        <br />
        üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ¬†Front End Engineers¬†could make screen quickly first without the help
        of designers.

    <p>
        The biggest difference between the old and new design is the introduction of the in-window preview. This simple addition transforms our cloud-based file browser into a comprehensive content previewer loaded with collaborative utilities. Users who don‚Äôt have certain applications can now preview proprietary file formats as well as leave comments or annotations on points of interest with just one click.
