        ProtoPie is the most intuitive tool to turn ideas into highly
        interactive prototypes for mobile, desktop, web, all the way to IoT. The
        software supports individuals and teams to ideate, iterate, and
        innovates tomorrow‚Äôs best digital products. I joined ProtoPie in 2017 to
        build a new Cloud and draw the first shape of the product.

          We saw the opportunity to grow the business from an increasing number

      <p> From 2018 to 2019, my team and I visited more than 20 companies in the Bay Area and Europe to find answers to the following questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> How does a team of designers collaborate together with prototypes? </li>
        <li> What do they do with prototypes after making it?</li>
        <li> Is there any new use case of prototyping made with ProtoPie? </li>

    <h3>Define ProtoPie Cloud's Workflow</h3>
    <img class="hero" src="images/cloud/workflow_default.png">
    <p>
        Before launching Cloud, ProtoPie supported a limited range of design workflows: ideation - prototype - deliver. 
        From our company visits and casual interviews with design teams, we realize that supporting the iterative design process and concept evaluation are the core experiences as a team of designers using ProtoPie. 
        Also, we found out that there is a strong need for managing these experiences for design leads or managers.

          <h2>Design System 1.0</h2>
          <p>
            Since the number of engineers outnumbered the number of designers, I had
            to develop an efficient way to support the iterative design process.
            With ProtoPie's brand designer and other product designers, I developed
            color schemes for the new product and other design primitives.
            Developing design system in the beginning of the project helped me to
            focus on bigger perspective of Cloud's user experience while saving the
            minimum quality of visual design.

        Extending workflow from prototyping to collaboration
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before launching Cloud, users maximize their prototyping in a minimal
        portion of a design workflow: prototyping. To support the iterative
        design process and user testing for tech designers, we believed it is
        essential to develop the features for collaboration and user testing.

          Prototypes shine when designers use those to validate their idea.
          Designers love the expressiveness of prototypes they made with
          ProtoPie and actively use those for their user testings. We created a
          suite of precise share display options for user's testing purposes.
