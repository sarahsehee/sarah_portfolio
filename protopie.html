          From November 2017 to October 2019, I led the design of ProtoPie Cloud
          to draw the first shape of the product. I focused on expanding its
          core experience from hi-fidelity prototyping to seamless iterative
          prototyping workflow.

      <h2>What is ProtoPie?</h2>
      <p>
        ProtoPie is the most intuitive tool to turn ideas into highly
        interactive prototypes for mobile, desktop, web, all the way to IoT. The
        software supports individuals and teams to ideate, iterate, and
        innovates tomorrow‚Äôs best digital products. I joined ProtoPie in 2017 to
        build a new Cloud and draw the first shape of the product.

        <h4>üìà Business Needs</h4>
        <p>
          We saw the opportunity to grow the business from an increasing number
          of corporate and team users since we launched ProtoPie Studio in the
          market.

        <h4>üò£ User Needs</h4>
        <p>
          Along with the development of ProtoPie Studio, users requested more
          advanced collaboration features such sharing options and prototyping
          management.

    <div class="text_container">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Not enough design resources to support sufficient exploratory research
          and fast product development
        </li>
        <li>
          Too many stakeholders, including engineering and strategy, marketing
          in the process of developing an MVP model
        </li>
        <li>
          Redefine the prototyping process and its impact on product development

    <p>
      I synthesized core features from several previous user interviews and
      collected user requests related to collaboration. I also reviewed the
      holistic flows from prototyping in ProtoPie Studio to interacting with
      prototypes in ProtoPie Player(Mobile Application Viewer). These activities
      helped me to drew the first rough information architecture and utilize it
      to talk about cloud architecture. <br /><br />
      I kept updating it repeatedly as we made progress in scope and the scope
      of the project. It performed as a source of truth for all stakeholders
      until we created user stories for development.

      <h2>Design System 1.0</h2>
      <p>
        Since the number of engineers outnumbered the number of designers, I had
        to develop an efficient way to support the iterative design process.
        With ProtoPie's brand designer and other product designers, I developed
        color schemes for the new product and other design primitives.
        Developing design system in the beginning of the project helped me to
        focus on bigger perspective of Cloud's user experience while saving the
        minimum quality of visual design.

        Extending workflow from prototyping to collaboration

        Before launching Cloud, users maximize their prototyping in a minimal
        portion of a design workflow: prototyping. To support the iterative
        design process and user testing for tech designers, we believed it is
        essential to develop the features for collaboration and user testing.
