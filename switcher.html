        Switcher is a smart light controller targeting a single or a married
        couple household in South Korea. The target user is aged 25 to 35 years
        old, living in a studio or one-bedroom apartment.

      <h2>What is Switcher Timer?</h2>
      <p>
        Switcher Timer turns on and off the light automatically, even without
        constant Bluetooth pairing. He can save a timer from turning on or off
        the light on the device by connecting Switcher app and a hardware
        controller via Bluetooth. <br /><br />

    <h2>Switcher Timer and the conversion rate</h2>
    <img src="images/switcher/flow.png" />
    <p>
      We found how Switcher Timer affects the conversion rate from quantitative and qualitative research. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
          Only 35.3% of users used the feature, but 67.5% of users who subscribed
          after the free-trial saved and used Switcher Timer.
      </li>
      <li>
          Users who use timers picked the longest and the most
          expansive subscription plan.
      </li>
  </div>

        Based on our hypothesis, the product team ran two weeks duration sprint
        twices. My role was to discover user problems around Switcher Timer and
        synthesize solutions.

      <h3>User Problems</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          During the interview, we found out that many users didn't know about the
          feature at all until we asked them why they didn't use it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not enough trust in the new connected device. They were worried if Timer
          didn't work while they cannot be physically next to the device.

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Dicover Opportunities </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>What if</strong> users can learn about Switcher Timer and its value inside mobile applications?
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What if</strong> users can test Switcher Timer and gain trust in it during the onboarding process?

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Design Solution</h3>
      <p>
        ⭐️Users can learn about Switcher Timer and test it in onboarding process by following three popups in sequence.

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>
          After two weeks, we reviewed GA to track the performance of the design. And we found out that there was 64% drop-off rate in the 1st popup, 79% in the 2nd popup, and 62% in the last pop up.
          <br/><br/>
          We all agreed that designing and developing the popup guide cost less but not an intuitive way to introduce important information. Users perceived it as more intrusive, so we moved on to find a better solution.

  <div class="wrapper_50 flex-column">
    <p>
        Before starting the second sprint, we ran a survey to users on free trials. First, we asked how many timers they used. Then, we asked if they are willing to pay for subscriptions after the free trial. Surprisingly, the free-to-paid conversion rate was 1.5 times higher if a user set more than three timers than users set no timers at all.

        <p>
          Since we found out that <strong> the number of timers </strong> affects the conversion rate, I focused more on "why users don't use more than two timers."

        <h3>Research</h3>
      <p> I ran another qualitative research with the marketer. The goal was to observe how the converted users use Switcher Timer and to discover key use cases for our target users. </p>

      <ol>

        Suggest multiple key usecases to help users to setup more than two
        timers.

        In the early design process, I used ProtoPie to iterate and validate interactions quickly. It was the first experiment to design an interactive design with long text sentences. By running internal user testings, we gained confidence in the features and value as we iterated.

            After running two 2-weeks sprints, we could validate our hypothesis: Switcher Timer affected the conversion rate indeed.
